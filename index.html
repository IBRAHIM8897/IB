    <h1>Autobiography of Ibrahim Ahmed Idris</h1>
    <img src="FAMILY.jpg" alt="Family Photo">
    <p>My name is <strong>Ibrahim Ahmed Idris</strong>, and I was born on <strong>August 11, 2007</strong>, in the vibrant city of <strong>Lagos, Nigeria</strong>. I come from a large, loving family with <strong>six siblings</strong>, and I’ve been blessed to grow up surrounded by support, laughter, and tradition. My upbringing in a close-knit home taught me the value of unity, respect, and responsibility from an early age.</p>

    <p>Lagos was where my childhood journey began — a city full of life and ambition. It was during my <strong>Junior Secondary School 3 (JSS3)</strong> that a major change came. My <strong>father received a transfer</strong>, and as a result, our entire family relocated to <strong>Kaduna</strong>. Moving away from Lagos was a major transition, but it opened new doors and gave me a fresh perspective on life.</p>

    <p>In Kaduna, I completed my secondary education at <strong>Rare Gem Academy</strong>, a place that played a key role in my academic and personal growth. The experience helped me adapt to new environments and pushed me to mature faster, learning how to make the most of new opportunities while staying true to my roots.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am <strong>awaiting university admission</strong>, but I haven’t allowed this waiting period to go to waste. Instead, I’ve channeled my time and focus into something that truly inspires me — <strong>programming</strong>. The world of technology fascinates me, and learning to code has become more than just a hobby; it's a gateway to the future I envision for myself. I spend time each day developing my programming skills and learning how to build, create, and solve real-world problems through technology.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy <strong>playing games</strong>, which helps me relax, stay mentally sharp, and develop strategic thinking. It’s more than fun — it’s part of how I challenge myself to think differently and creatively.</p>

    <p>My biggest dream is to be <strong>successful and wealthy</strong>, but my definition of success goes beyond money. I want to live a life filled with purpose, leave a positive impact on the world, and be in a position to support and uplift others — especially my family, who have always stood by me.</p>

    <p>Though my journey is still at its beginning, I believe deeply in the power of <strong>discipline, focus, and continuous learning</strong>. Every experience — from Lagos to Kaduna, from school to self-study — has shaped me into the person I am becoming. I’m determined to turn my dreams into reality and write a story that others will one day look up to.</p>

    <p>This is my story so far — and the best chapters are still to come.</p>
